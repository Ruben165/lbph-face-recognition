Face Recognition with Python and OpenCV. Uses Haar-Cascade Classifier for Face Detection and LBPH Algorithm for Face Recognition. The 'images' folder contains the data used for training and validation purposes. Delete the 'fr_model.yml' and 'name_list.npy' files manually everytime you want to train a new model. Those files will be created everytime after training a new model.
